Machine Learning Approach For Heart Failure Prediction 

Abstract 


Heart failure represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by high mortality rates 
and considerable healthcare costs. Traditional statistical models often struggle to detect subtle 
patterns in patient data, prompting the need for advanced predictive methods. 
This project uses historical clinical data to develop
a machine-learning model to predict heart failure with high accuracy. 
We evaluated five popular machine-learning techniques Logistic Regression, Random Forest, 
Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors utilizing a publicly available 
dataset from Kaggle.com. These models were chosen due to their good performance in medical 
applications and the pressing need to improve heart failure management and survival rates. The 
performance of each model was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and an 
overall average score, based on 12 predictor features of heart failure. Logistic Regression and 
Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy at 87%, with 83% and 85% precision scores, 
respectively. SVM achieved slightly lower accuracy (85%) but maintained competitive precision. 
Overall average scores corroborated these findings, with LR and RF scoring above 81. These 
results underscore the effectiveness of LR and RF in predicting heart failure, suggesting their 
potential for clinical application. Future work may focus on model enhancements and incorporating additional features to improve predictive performance further.
