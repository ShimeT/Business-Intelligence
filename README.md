#TMachine Learning Approach For Heart Failure Prediction 

##Abstract 
Heart failure represents a significant global health challenge, characterized by high mortality rates and considerable healthcare costs. Traditional statistical models often struggle to detect subtle patterns in patient data, prompting the need for advanced predictive methods. This project develops a machine learning model to predict heart failure with high accuracy using historical clinical data. We evaluated five popular machine learning techniques Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors utilizing a publicly available dataset from Kaggle.com. These models were chosen due to their good performance in medical applications and the pressing need to improve heart failure management and survival rates. The performance of each model was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and an overall average score, based on 12 predictor features of heart failure. Logistic Regression and Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy at 87%, with precision scores of 83% and 85%, respectively. SVM achieved slightly lower accuracy (85%) but maintained competitive precision. In contrast, Decision Trees and KNN showed lower performance across all metrics, with accuracies of 77% and a notably low recall of 39% for KNN. F1-scores reflected a trade-off between precision and recall, with Logistic Regression leading at 80%, while KNN lagged at 54%. Overall average scores corroborated these findings, with LR and RF scoring above 81, whereas DT and KNN fell below 70. These results underscore the effectiveness of LR and RF in predicting heart failure, suggesting their potential for clinical application. Future work may focus on model enhancements and the incorporation of additional features to further improve predictive performance.
